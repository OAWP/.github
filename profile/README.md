# OAWP - Open Animated Wallpaper Player

The Open Animated Wallpaper Player (OAWP) project is a Free and Open Source animated wallpaper player, licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3 or later.

The project's visions features a CLI daemon and a GUI manager, supporting the following operating systems:
* POSIX operating systems with Xorg/X11 - codename XAWP (unstable/developing);
* POSIX operating systems with Wayland - codename WAWP (non-existent)
* Microsoft Windows - codename WinAWP (non-existent);
* Apple macOS - codename MAWP (not-existent);

For now, the project is under heavy development with absolutely no stability.
